Kartagony is a small unreleased, unfinished, multiplayer game, where players 
drives small karts and use items to kill each others (in Team Deathmatch mode).

The "main" file is kartagony.c: it will include all others, so you just have
to compile this one.

The game *should* (not tested since a long time) work with the regular
generic Raydium server (tests.c).

All data *should* be available on official repository, too.
