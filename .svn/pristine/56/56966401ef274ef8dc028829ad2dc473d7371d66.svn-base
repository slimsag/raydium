// Introduction
/**
Raydium provides its own atexit function, since Win32 DLL requires a bit
of magic for such things. This support is mainly here for internal reasons,
you can continue to use regular atexit() in your applications.
**/


__rayapi int raydium_atexit(void (*func)(void));
/**
As the original atexit():
Register a function to be called at normal program termination.
Functions so registered are called in the reverse order of their
registration; no arguments are passed.
Returns 0 if successful.
**/

__rayapi void raydium_atexit_call(void);
/**
Internal use. Will call all registered functions.
**/

__rayapi void raydium_atexit_init(void);
/**
Internal use.
