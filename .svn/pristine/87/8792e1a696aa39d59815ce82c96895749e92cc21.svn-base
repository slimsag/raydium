I've a few unreleased tests about shaders that may help other people
working on this subject. 

For now, I only release this water shader demo, since other tests are 
heavily based on the official "shader_test.c", and it will only
duplicate (almost) the same code everywhere. I'll try to clean all this one day.

Xfennec.
