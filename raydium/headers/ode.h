// Introduction
/**
Raydium allows you to build applications with full physics, using ODE (Open
Dynamics Engine). ODE is "an open source, high performance library for
simulating rigid body dynamics", and is fully integrated into Raydium, with
the usual abstraction. You can build cars, ragdolls, rockets, ... with
only few lines of code. Physics are linked to sound API, particles engine,
network layer, ... so you've almost nothing else to do but setting up objects.

Raydium's website provides tutorials for building physics ready applications.
**/


// Vocabulary
/**
Raydium physics use a simple vocabulary, with a few entities :
- **Objects:**
Objects are containers, with no direct visual appearance. An object contains
elements and joints (see below). By default, all elements in an object
doesn't collide each others. "Car", "Player", "Crane" are good object examples.

- **Elements:**
Elements are the main thing you will play with. An element is rendered using
an associated 3D mesh, is configured with a geometry, density, a size,
collides with others elements, ...
An element **must** be owned by an object.
For now, there is 3 element types (standard, satic, fixing). Static elements
are unmovable, they just collide with other elements, usefull for very
big elements, or externally controlled elements (motion capture, network,
haptic interface, ...), for example.
Raydium supports boxes and spheres.

- **Joints:**
Joints are dedicated to elements linking. A joint **must** be linked with two
elements or unwanted behaviors may happen.
For now, Raydium supports 4 joint types (hinge, hinge2, universal, fixed), and
you will find more informations with suitable functions documentation, below.
On a joint, you could setup limits (min and max for all axes) and a maximum
force before joint breaks, if needed.
It's now possible to attach a joint to static environnement using the
constant ##RAYDIUM_ODE_JOINT_FIXED## (do not use this value with "_name" joint
functions, since they want a string, not a integer constant).

- **Motors:**
A motor is linked to joints, and may powering an unlimited amount of joints.
For now, 3 motor types are available: engine, angular and rocket.

**Engine** type works the same way as a car's engine: it will try to
make "something" turning, at the desired **speed**. You can link a
gearbox to this type (and only this one).

**Angular** type will try to rotate "something" to the desired **angle**,
usefull for car's front wheels, for example.

**Rocket type** is very simple: give a force and an orientation. Usefull for
creating copters, rockets, and for elements "pushing", for example.
Special rocket is avaiblable for FPS style player controls.
Warning, a rocket is linked to an element ! (not a joint)

- **Explosions:**
Explosions are not directly related to rigid body physics, but consider it
as a high level primitive.
With Raydium, you have two different ways to create an explosion.

First, you can create a "blowing explosion", generating a spherical blow. Any
element in this growing sphere will be ejected.
Use this for very consequent explosions only !

Next, you can create an instantaneous explosion, with a degressive blowing
effect. A force is applied to every body found inside the blowing radius,
proportional to distance from the explosion's center. Usefull for smaller
explosions.

- **Launchers:**
Launchers are not real entities, but "only" tools. Obviously, they are
allowing you to launch an element (you must provide force and orientation)
from another element (relatively). More informations about launchers below.

// About RayODE names
/**
 - Important: All ODE Objects, elements, motors,... **must have unique name** !
So, here is an example of what you **SHOULD NOT DO**:
%%(c)
int car1=raydium_ode_object_create("car");
int car2=raydium_ode_object_create("car");
int car3=raydium_ode_object_create("car");
%%

Ant this is the right way:
%%(c)
int car1=raydium_ode_object_create("car1");
int car2=raydium_ode_object_create("car2");
int car3=raydium_ode_object_create("car3");
%%
**/

// Callbacks
/**
For **advanced** uses, you may want to enter into some "internal" parts of
RayODE. Many callbacks are available for such needs.
To cancel any callback, set its value to ##NULL## (default value).
Here is a quick list:

- ##raydium_ode_StepCallback##
This callback is fired before every ODE callback. Since physcis callback
frequency may change (see ##raydium_ode_time_change##) during slow motion
scenes, for example, this callback is quiet useful.
Callback prototype: ##void f(void);##


- ##raydium_ode_ObjectNearCollide##
When two objects are too near, before lauching "expensive" collision tests,
Raydium is firing this event.

Callback prototype: ##signed char f(int obj1, int obj2);##
##obj1## and ##obj2## are the two objets, and you must return true (1) if
you want to "validate" collision, or false (0) if you don't want that two
objects to collide.


- ##raydium_ode_CollideCallback##
When two objects collides, Raydium will search all collisions between
every elements. For each contact, this callback is fired. For complex
objects, with a lot of elements, this callback may be fired a **very** large
number of times during **one** ODE step ! Do only simple things here.

Callback prototype: ##signed char f(int e1, int e2, dContact *c);##
##e1## and ##e2## are the two colliding elements, and you must return true (1)
if you want to "validate" this contact, or false (0) to cancel this contact
(and only this one !)

See ODE documentation, chapter 7.3.7, for more informations about ##dContact##
structure.


- ##raydium_ode_ExplosionCallback##
At every explosion, of any type, this event is fired. This is the best
place to play suitable sound, create particles and such things.

Callback prototype: ##void f(signed char type, dReal radius, dReal force_or_propag, dReal *pos);##
You can find in callback params:
explosion ##type## (see above), ##radius##, force or propag (depending on
explosion type) and ##pos##, an array of 3 dReal values for explosion position.
The value you will find in ##force_or_propag## is something
like ##RAYDIUM_ODE_NETWORK_EXPLOSION_*## (EXPL or BLOW).


- ##raydium_ode_BeforeElementDrawCallback##
When ##raydium_ode_draw_all(RAYDIUM_ODE_DRAW_NORMAL)## is called, for every
element to draw, this callback is **before** element drawing.

Callback prototype: ##signed char f(int elem);##
##elem## is the element'id. Return true (1) if you want to draw this element,
or false (0) otherwise. This is also the best place to drawn team colors on
cars, for example (see ##raydium_rendering_rgb_force## for this use).


- ##raydium_ode_AfterElementDrawCallback##
Same as the previous callback, but **after** element drawing.

Callback prototype: ##void f(int elem);##
With the previous example (team colors), this is the place to restore
default rendering state (see ##raydium_rendering_rgb_normal##).

- ##raydium_ode_RayCallback##
See ray related functions, below. This callback is used to filter
elements and create contacts during a ray launch.
**/


// Miscallenous
/**
By default, ODE is called 400 times per second, allowing **very** accurate
physics. You may change this using ##raydium_ode_set_physics_freq##,
but most ERP and CFM values must be changed in your
applications. ODE use a lot of cache mechanisms, so 400 Hz is a reasonable value.

Please note RayODE interface is using ##dReal## ODE type for variables.
For now, ##dReal## is an alias to ##float## type. But please use ##sizeof()##.

Raydium provides some other functions for advanced uses, and you can
access directly to ODE API for very experienced users.

During your ##raydium_ode_CollideCallback##, you may want to save forces

Most of the time, this value is the "current" element id, like the wheel id
during a road/wheel contact, for instance. It's then very easy to get the saved
forces and torques during the next physics iteration using the same id (the
wheel id is the same from one iteration to another).
