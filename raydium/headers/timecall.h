// Concept
/**
As you may already know, in a real time application (as a game), you need
to control in-game time evolution.
For example, you cannot increment a car position by 1 at each frame since
it will generate an irregular scrolling (a frame is never rendered within
the same time as the previous or the next one).

Raydium supports timecalls, wich are a great solution for this problem.
Usage is very simple: write a simple function, and ask Raydium to call it
at the desired rate.
**/

// Constraints
/**
There is an important risk with timecalls: infinite loops.
If a callback is long, it may take more CPU time than it should, as in this
very simple example:

foo() is a function, taking 200 ms for his own execution. If you ask for
a 6 Hz execution, Raydium will execute foo() six times on the first frame,
taking 1200 ms. On the next frame, Raydium will need to execute foo() 7
times (the asked 6 times, and one more for the 200 ms lost during the last
frame), taking 1400 ms, so 8 times will be needed for the next frame, then 9, ...

So you need to create callbacks as short as possible, since long callbacks
may cause a game freeze on slower machines than yours. (1 FPS syndrom)
**/

// Hardware devices and methods
/**
Raydium must use a very accurate system timer, and will try many methods:
##/dev/rtc## , ##gettimeofday()## (Linux only) and
##QueryPerformanceCounter## for win32.

##gettimeofday()## will use a CPU counter and is extremely accurate.
It's far the best method. (0.001 ms accuracy is possible)

##/dev/rtc## is quite good, and Raydium will try to configure RTC at
##RAYDIUM_TIMECALL_FREQ_PREFERED## rate (8192 Hz by default), but may
require a "##/proc/sys/dev/rtc/max-user-freq##" modification:
##echo 8192 > /proc/sys/dev/rtc/max-user-freq##

You may want to look at common.c for interesting defines about timecalls.

There is two sort of timecalls with Raydium:

1. Standard ones:

raydium_timecall_add(function,800);
%%
##void function(void)## will be called 800 times per second.

2. Elastic timed ones:
%%(c)
raydium_timecall_add(function,-80);
%%
##void function(float step)## will be called for each frame, with a
"##step## factor" as argument. In the above example, a 160 Hz game will call
function with step = 0.5, but step = 2.0 for a 40 Hz game.

A standard timecall will use ##void(void)## function and a positive ##hertz##
